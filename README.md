# **Project Overview**
- This project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Airbnb listings dataset for New York City (2019).
- It aims to extract valuable insights into pricing, availability, and neighborhood trends using Python.
- The dataset contains information on 48,895 listings, which were analyzed and visualized to uncover significant patterns.

# **Features**
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and optimized data for analysis.
- Data Visualization: Created correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms using seaborn and matplotlib.
- Statistical Analysis: Examined correlations and factors influencing pricing and availability.

# **How to Get Started**
  - To explore and run the project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

    **Prerequisites**
      - Make sure you have the following installed:
      - Python 3.x
      - Jupyter Notebook
      - Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
      
    **Instructions**
      - Clone the repository:
          `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airbnb-eda-project.git`
          `cd airbnb-eda-project`
      - Install the required libraries:
          `pip install -r requirements.txt`
      - Open the Jupyter Notebook:
        `jupyter notebook eda_project.ipynb`
    - Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

# **Data Source**
- The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and includes information on Airbnb listings such as prices, reviews, availability, and locations.

# **Insights & Conclusions**
- Neighborhoods like Manhattan and Brooklyn have higher average listing prices compared to other areas.
- Listings with more reviews tend to have lower prices, suggesting a competitive market in popular neighborhoods.
- Correlation analysis reveals that room type and location are the most influential factors on pricing.
